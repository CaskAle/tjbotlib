# TJBot Library

> Node.js library that encapsulates TJBot's capabilities: seeing, listening, speaking, shining, and waving.

This library can be used to create your own recipes for [TJBot](http://ibm.biz/mytjbot).

Some of TJBot's capabilities require [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) services. For example, seeing is powered by the [IBM Watson Visual Recognition](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-visual-recognition) service. Speaking and listening are powered by the [IBM Watson Text to Speech](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-text-to-speech) and [IBM Watson Speech to Text](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text) services.

To use these services, you will need to sign up for a free [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) account, create instances of the services you need, and download the authentication credentials.

## Usage

1. Install the library using `npm`.

```
$ npm install --save tjbot
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note: The TJBot library was developed for use on Raspberry Pi. It may be possible to develop and test portions of this library on other Linux-based systems (e.g. Ubuntu), but this usage is not officially supported.

2. Instantiate the `TJBot` object.

```
import TJBot from 'tjbot';
const tj = new TJBot();
tj.initialize([TJBot.HARDWARE.LED, TJBot.HARDWARE.SERVO, TJBot.HARDWARE.MICROPHONE, TJBot.HARDWARE.SPEAKER]);
```

This code will configure your TJBot with an `LED`, `servo`, `microphone`, and `speaker`. The default configuration of TJBot uses English as the main language with a male voice. Here is an example of a TJBot that speaks with a female voice in Japanese:

```
var tj = new TJBot({ 
    robot: { 
        gender: TJBot.GENDERS.FEMALE 
    }, 
    speak: { 
        language: TJBot.LANGUAGES.SPEAK.JAPANESE 
    }
});
```

### IBM Watson Credentials

If you are using IBM Watson services, store your authentication credentials in a file named `ibm-credentials.env`. Credentials may be downloaded from the page for your service instance, in the section named "Credentials."

If you are using multiple IBM Watson services, you may combine all of the credentials together in a single file.

The file `ibm-credentials.sample.env` shows a sample of how credentials are stored.

> ðŸ’¡ Note: You may also specify the path to the credentials file in the TJBot constructor using the `credentialsFile` argument. For example, `const tj = new TJBot(credentialsFile="/home/pi/my-credentials.env")`.

## Hardware Configuration

The entire list of hardware devices supported by TJBot is defined in `TJBot.HARDWARE` and includes `CAMERA`, `LED`, `MICROPHONE`, `SERVO`, and `SPEAKER`. Each of these hardware devices may be configured by passing in configuration options to the `TJBot` constructor as follows.

```
var configuration = {
    log: {
        level: 'info', // valid levels are 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'verbose', 'debug', 'silly'
    },
    robot: {
        gender: TJBot.GENDERS.MALE, // see TJBot.GENDERS
    },
    converse: {
        assistantId: undefined, // placeholder for Watson Assistant's assistantId
    },
    listen: {
        microphoneDeviceId: 'plughw:1,0', // plugged-in USB card 1, device 0; see 'arecord -l' for a list of recording devices
        inactivityTimeout: -1, // -1 to never timeout or break the connection. Set this to a value in seconds e.g 120 to end connection after 120 seconds of silence
        backgroundAudioSuppression: 0.4, // should be in the range [0.0, 1.0] indicating how much audio suppression to perform
        language: TJBot.LANGUAGES.LISTEN.ENGLISH_US, // see TJBot.LANGUAGES.LISTEN
    },
    wave: {
        servoPin: 7, // corresponds to BCM 7 / physical PIN 26
    },
    speak: {
        language: TJBot.LANGUAGES.SPEAK.ENGLISH_US, // see TJBot.LANGUAGES.SPEAK
        voice: undefined, // use a specific voice; if undefined, a voice is chosen based on robot.gender and speak.language
        speakerDeviceId: 'plughw:0,0', // plugged-in USB card 1, device 0; 'see aplay -l' for a list of playback devices
    },
    see: {
        confidenceThreshold: 0.6,
        camera: {
            height: 720,
            width: 960,
            verticalFlip: false, // flips the image vertically, may need to set to 'true' if the camera is installed upside-down
            horizontalFlip: false, // flips the image horizontally, should not need to be overridden
        },
        language: TJBot.LANGUAGES.SEE.ENGLISH_US,
    },
};
const tj = new TJBot(configuration);
```

## Capabilities

TJBot has a number of capabilities that you can use to bring it to life. Capabilities are combinations of hardware and Watson services that enable TJBot's functionality. For example, "listening" is a combination of having a `speaker` and the `speech_to_text` service. Internally, the `_assertCapability()` method checks to make sure your TJBot is configured with the right hardware and services before it performs an action that depends on having a capability. Thus, the method used to make TJBot listen, `tj.listen()`, first checks that your TJBot has been configured with a `speaker` and the `speech_to_text` service.

TJBot's capabilities are:

- **Analyzing Tone** with the [Watson Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-tone-analyzer) service
- **Conversing** with the [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/) service
- **Listening** with the [Watson Speech to Text](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-speech-to-text) service
- **Seeing** with the [Watson Visual Recognition](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-visual-recognition) service
- **Shining** its LED
- **Speaking** with the [Watson Text to Speech](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-text-to-speech) service
- **Translating** between languages with the [Watson Language Translator](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-language-translator) service
- **Waving**  its arm

The full list of capabilities can be accessed programatically via `TJBot.CAPABiLITIES`, the full list of hardware components can be accessed programatically via `TJBot.HARDWARE`, and the full list of Watson services can be accessed programatically via `TJBot.SERVICES`.

response = {
    "object": {conversation response object},
    "description": "hello, how are you"
}
```

## Listen

### tj.listen(callback)

Opens the microphone and streams data to the `speech_to_text` service.

- `callback` is called with speech utterances as they are produced

Sample usage:

```
tj.listen(function(text) {
    ...
});
```

Sample response:

```
text = "hello tjbot my name is bobby"
```

### tj.pauseListening()

Pauses listening.

### tj.resumeListening()

Resumes listening.

### tj.stopListening()

Stops listening.

## See

### tj.see()

Returns a list of objects seen and their confidences.

Sample usage:

tj.see().then(function(objects) {
    ...
});
```

Sample response:

```
objects =
[
    {
        "class": "apple",
        "score": 0.645656
    },
    {
        "class": "fruit",
        "score": 0.598688
    },
    {
        "class": "food",
        "score": 0.598688
    },
    {
        "class": "orange",
        "score": 0.5
    },
    {
        "class": "vegetable",
        "score": 0.28905
    },
    {
        "class": "tree",
        "score": 0.28905
    }
]
```

### tj.recognizeObjectsInPhoto(filePath)

Returns a list of objects seen and their confidences in the given photo.

- `filePath` is the path to the photo to use.

Sample usage:

```
tj.recognizeObjectsInPhoto(filePath).then(function(objects)) {
    ...
});
```

The response is the same as `tj.see()`.

### tj.read()

Returns a list of text strings read by TJBot.

Sample usage:

```
tj.read().then(function(texts) {
    ...
});
```

Sample response:

```
TBD
```

### tj.recognizeTextInPhoto(filePath)

Returns a list of text strings read by TJBot in the given photo.

- `filePath` is the path to the photo to use.

Sample usage:

```
tj.recognizeTextInPhoto(filePath).then(function(texts)) {
    ...
});
```

The response is the same as `tj.read()`.

### tj.takePhoto(targetPath)

Takes an argument of the path `targetPath` where the image file should be saved. If `targetPath` is null, image is stored in a temporary location. This method also returns the location `filePath` where image file was saved.

Sample usage:

```
tj.takePhoto(targetPath).then(function(filePath) {
    ...
});
```

Sample response:

```
filePath = "test.jpg"
```

## Shine

### tj.shine(color)

Shines the LED the specified color.

- `color` may be specified as a name, e.g. `'red'` or `'blue'`, or it may be specified as a hex string, e.g. `'#FF0000'` or `'#0000FF'`.

A full list of colors that TJBot understands can be accessed via `tj.shineColors()`.

Sample usage:

```
tj.shine('orange');
tj.shine('pink');
tj.shine('#0A2C9F');
```

### tj.pulse(color, duration)

Pulses the LED the given color (e.g. fades in and out to the given color).

- `color` specifies the color of the pulse
- `duration` specifies how long the pulse should last. TJBot will throw an error if the duration is less than 0.5 seconds or greater than 2 seconds, as pulses outside of these bounds are not very reliable.

Sample usage:

```
tj.pulse('blue', 1.0);
```

### tj.shineColors()

Returns an array of all of the colors that TJBot understands.

### tj.randomColor()

Selects a random color from the array returned by `tj.shineColors()`.

## Speak

## tj.speak(message)

Speaks the given message using `text_to_speech`.

- `message` is the message to speak

Sample usage:

```
tj.speak("hello world").then(function() {
    return tj.speak("my name is tjbot");
}).then(function () {
    return tj.speak("it's very nice to meet you!");
});
```

In this example, TJBot will first speak "hello world". After audio playback has finished, it will then speak "my name is tjbot". After audio playback has finished, it will then speak "it's very nice to meet you!". The [Promise pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises) is used here to ensure that statements can be spoken consecutively without interference.

## tj.play(soundFile)

Plays the given sound file.

- `soundFile` is the path to the sound file to play

Sample usage:

```
tj.play('/usr/share/doc/Greenfoot/scenarios/lunarlander/sounds/Explosion.wav');
```

# Translate

## tj.translate(text, sourceLanguage, targetLanguage)

Translates the given text from the source language to the target language.

- `sourceLanguage` is the 2 character string that identifies the language from which to translate
- `targetLanguage` is the 2 character string that identifies the language to which to translate

> Note: Not all languages can be translated to other languages! Use the method `tj.isTranslatable()` to determine if a translation model exists between a soruce and target langauge.

Below are examples of common languages and the 2 character strings used to represent them.

| Language | Code |
|---|---|
| Arabic | ar |
| Chinese | zh |
| German | de |
| English | en |
| French | fr |
| Italian | it |
| Japanese | ja |
| Korean | ko |
| Spanish | es |
| Portuguese | pt |

Sample usage:

```
tj.translate("Hello, my name is TJBot!", 'en', 'es').then(function(translation) {
    ...
});
```

Sample response:

```
translation = {
	"translations":[
		{
			"translation":"Hola, mi nombre es TJBot!"
		}
	],
	"word_count":5,
	"character_count":24
}
```

## tj.identifyLanguage(text)

Identifies the language in which the text was written.

- `text` is the text whose language should be identified

Sample usage:

```
tj.identifyLanguage("Hello, my name is TJBot!").then(function(languages) {
    ...
});

```

Sample response:

```
languages = {
	"languages":[
		{
			"language":"en",
			"confidence":0.865653
		},
		{
			"language":"af",
			"confidence":0.039473
		},
		{
			"language":"nl",
			"confidence":0.0276556
		},
		{
			"language":"nn",
			"confidence":0.0216675
		},
		...
	]
}
```

## tj.isTranslatable(sourceLanguage, targetLanguage)

Returns a Promise that resolves to `true` if there exists a translation model between the source language and the target language.

- `sourceLanguage` is the 2 character string that identifies the source language
- `targetLanguage` is the 2 character string that identifies the target language

> Note: This method is asynchronous due to the need to load the list of translation models available. If you are confident that the list of translation models has been loaded (e.g. you call `tj.isTranslatable()` a few seconds after your script has been running), you may wish to use the internal method `tj._isTranslatable()` instead.

Sample usage:

```
tj.isTranslatable('en', 'es').then(function(result) {
    if (result) {
        console.log("TJBot can translate between English and Spanish!");
    } else {
        console.log("TJBot cannot translate between English and Spanish.");
    }
});
```

Sample response:

```
TJBot can translate between English and Spanish!
```
